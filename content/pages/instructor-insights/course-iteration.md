_In this section, Jared Berezin discusses how he plans to modify future iterations of the course._

Based primarily on student feedback, I plan to continue the trend in this course of increasing the ratio of writing to reading. Specifically, Iâ€™d like to generate additional [communication experiments]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/communication-experiments) and incorporate them at targeted moments throughout the term. Increasing opportunities for active learning, in which students apply conceptual knowledge to real-time communication challenges, will further add to the energy of the classroom. This effort would coincide with a re-visiting of the [assigned readings]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/ReadingsandReadingResponses), in order to consider whether any texts can be removed, shortened (i.e. occasionally assigning targeted excerpts rather than full articles), or replaced by other media.
